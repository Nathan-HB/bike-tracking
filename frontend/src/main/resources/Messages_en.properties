#FAQ Page content
faq.title=Bike Tracker FAQ | Protect your bike in real time.
faq.meta.description="This is my meta description for english"
faq.header=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.question1=What is bike-tracker?
faq.answer1=AllTrac is our management platform for our BikeTrac product. This is where you can manage your account and devices. You may see ALLTRAC.CO.UK on your card statement. This is a subscription payment from us.
faq.question2=Can I transfer my BikeTrac unit to another bike?
faq.answer2=Yes, your BikeTrac unit is registered to you personally, so it can be transferred between machines. Please log-in to your portal and select 'disable SOC' before removal and then arrange unit swap. Once installed on your new machine, log-in and update your bike details before reenabling 'SOC'. If you experience any issues or need advice please email - hello@biketrac.co.uk
faq.question3=Will BikeTrac drain my battery?
faq.answer3=Bike Trac has its own internal battery, so it only draws power from your bike's battery when it needs it. However, BikeTrac also notifies you if your battery voltage drops via text message, so you should never be left with a flat battery.
faq.question4=Do I get charged additionally for text messages, phone calls or emails?
faq.answer4=No, everything is included in the subscription, so there's no extra charge. Unlike some other tracking products you'll never be left without credit, so as long as your subscription is valid your bike is always protected.
faq.question5=Can I see my bike in real-time?
faq.answer5=Yes, BikeTrac returns location data even when your machine is turned off and parked up. Want reassurance it's where you left it still? No problems, just log-in to your account and check.
faq.question6=Can I fit my own BikeTrac unit?
faq.answer6=While BikeTrac is relatively easy to install, we strongly advise that it is installed by one of our authorised dealers. For insurance purposes a qualified installer should be used to make sure that your unit is correctly fitted in a covert location
faq.question7=What happens if my bike is stolen?
faq.answer7=Your unit will notify you via text message and email of the movement, while at the same time our Secure Operating Centre (SOC) will make contact with you immediately via phone call to confirm that the bike is missing. If theft is confirmed, our team will liaise with the local police to pinpoint its exact location and direct police officers / the recovery team to the location.
